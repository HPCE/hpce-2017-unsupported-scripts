These are _unsupported_ versions of the test scripts for CW1-CW4.
If you want to try to run them locally, you'll need to try to
deal with any errors that occur (e.g. file permissions problems,
missing tools, etc.). They aren't designed to be difficult to
run, but neither are they necessarily easy to run (though maybe
they are).

They are designed to run only in an environment that I control,
which is nominally the AWS HPCE AMI or an equivalent vagrant
install, but may include other tools that have been manually added
that I didn't think about. They are also likely to drift out of sync
with the master scripts, as they won't contain any point fixes.
